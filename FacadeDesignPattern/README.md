###We are going to develop a calculator using facade design pattern:

#Facade Design Pattern
- Facade design pattern is a structural design pattern. It is used to hide complexity of subsystem and provide simple and easy to use interface to clients.
- There are various use case of facade design pattern such as follows:
[1] To create wrapper for third party API integrations
[2] To create bridge between legacy code and latest release. It is useful when our application is divided into more than one programming language
[3] To limit the functionality by creating separate classes
